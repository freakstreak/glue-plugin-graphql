# How it works

- GraphQL plugin is started by **Glue Engine plugin**.



- **Glue Engine plugin** runs the graphql engine.



- In order to start this plugin we need to run the following command:
    
    ```bash
    $ node glue develop:up
    ```
    
    This command will start running the docker image of all the instances 
    and plugin we have created. Here, in this case it will up the hasura 
    image named as **graphql**.
    



    
- We can go to “[http://localhost:8080/console](http://localhost:8080/console)” and check our hasura console running.



- Now we can go to our hasura console running on “[http://localhost:8080/console](http://localhost:8080/console)” and start our development from there.



- In order to know how to start development using hausra we can refer to the hasura documentation. Here is the official link of hasura docs:
[https://hasura.io/docs/latest/index/](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/index/).



- In order to use our graphql endpoint to interact with our database by using quries  we can go to our hasura console and from there we can pick it up.
